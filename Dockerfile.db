# Use official MySQL 8.0 image
FROM mysql:8.0

# This Dockerfile is minimal because we leverage two key Docker features:
# 1. The official image's entrypoint, which automatically runs SQL scripts
#    mounted to /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d.
# 2. Docker Compose volume mounting, which handles the persistence and script insertion.

# No further instructions needed, as we rely on the official image entrypoint
# and docker-compose volume mounting for the initial script.
